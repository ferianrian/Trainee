Kind of Regression Type

Multiple Linear Regression = Common Regression
Polinomial Regression      = Rarest Regression
SVM                        = Good Regression Method
Decission Tree 	 	   = I think it's better for classification
Random Forest Regression   = Generate other data, as far this one was the best method
